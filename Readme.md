## My process
Started by creating an index.html file. This file contained all of  of my html proprerties used to build this landing page. After which i moved onto my style.css file, basically everything i used to style and beautify my landing page was in this folder. I had to import fonts from google fonts as instructed. The process was not so easy, i kept missing one tag or the other, but with time i got a hang of it.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

```html
<div>Some HTML code I'm proud of</div>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  display:inline-flex;
}
```


### Continued development

This is just front end web development. i am basically stil at the bottm as i am looking to become a full stack developer.
so yes, i will continue trying until i attain my goal.


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://w3schools.com) - This website is really explanatory, ypu definitely will find solutions to your problems. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://stackoverflow.com/) - Stack overflow is also a very good place to go when you have problems with your code.It is easy because, you are able to find and communicate with others who have had the same challenge or something similar. That way, you know that you are not alone.
